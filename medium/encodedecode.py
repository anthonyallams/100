ENCODE AND DECODE STRINGS
https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. 
The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings. Please implement encode and decode

Example1
Input: ["lint","code","love","you"] Output: ["lint","code","love","you"] 
Explanation: One possible encode method is: "lint:;code:;love:;you"

Example2
Input: ["we", "say", ":", "yes"] Output: ["we", "say", ":", "yes"] 
Explanation: One possible encode method is: "we:;say:;:::;yes‚Äù

Note:
The string may contain any possible characters out of 256 valid ascii characters. 
Your algorithm should be generalized enough to work on any possible characters.
Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your encode and decode algorithms should be stateless.
Do not rely on any library method such as eval or serialize methods. You should implement your own encode/decode algorithm.
